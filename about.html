                  <p>Hot Beans Web was founded in 2013 by Christian Asare, following his experience working in a multinational company. Christian identified a gap in the market — a need for a web design agency that could combine professional, high-quality websites with affordability. His goal was to create a business that didn’t compromise on design or functionality, even for clients with smaller budgets.</p>
                    
                  More than a decade later, Hot Beans Web has proven to be a successful and growing agency. Our commitment to quality, transparency, and client satisfaction has allowed us to expand steadily each year. Our head office is located in Peterborough, with additional offices in Northampton, and we proudly support remote working for team members and clients across the UK.
                  <h3>Our Clients</h3>

                  <p>We work with a wide variety of clients — from sole traders and small businesses to national organisations and global brands. Our development experience includes projects for major companies such as Belkin, DSG Group, Ingram Micro, Halfords, Nationwide, and Tesco.

That said, our favourite projects are often with local businesses and startups — including plumbers, electricians, builders, and gardeners — who rely on us to help bring their businesses online and grow their customer base. We believe in giving back and supporting others, which is why we never charge for initial consultations. Whether you need advice, guidance, or just a second opinion — we’re happy to help.</p>

                  <h3>Our Team</h3>
                  <p>Hot Beans Web is powered by a passionate and talented team of web designers, developers, and digital marketers. Everyone on our team shares the same core goal: to deliver smart, creative, and effective digital solutions tailored to each client's unique needs.

We take pride in our diverse and inclusive team culture, which helps us think outside the box and stay ahead of industry trends. Collaboration, innovation, and a strong client-first mindset are at the heart of everything we do.</p>
